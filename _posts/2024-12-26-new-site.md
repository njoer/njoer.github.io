### Basis for New Site
Chirpy theme is the new basis for my personal site. At first, I launched the site using the minima theme, but decided to change to chirpy. I forked the Chirpy Theme repository and plan to modify my site from there.

### Domain from CloudFlare
Personal domain is definitely a good idea to have. I bought the domain from CloudFlare as their pricing was competitive and the yearly cost does not increase in the future
