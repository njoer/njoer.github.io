## New Site
The new site is hosted through GitHub Pages. The site uses GitHub Actions as it's CI/CD pipeline and the site is built on the static site generator Jekyll which is written in Ruby.

As I am also learning to code on C#, there might be some future ideas to make a Web App using ASP.NET Core Blazor.

## Theme
I changed the site theme to [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy).

At first, I launched the site using the minima theme, but decided to change to Chirpy as it had more features built in, from which I could learn from. I forked the Chirpy-repository and plan to modify my site from there. Chirpy also offers an easier starter option if you only plan to do minor modifications, making future upgrades easier.


## Custom Domain
Personalized domain is definitely a good idea to have when talking about personal sites. I bought the domain from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/) as their pricing was competitive and the yearly cost does not increase in the future. Cloudflare offers easy administration and variety of data-analytics dashboards. 

>Free plan of Cloudflare offers your website free SSL-certificate, CDN (Content Delivery Network), DDoS-mitigation, fast DNS-resolver and other security features.

## What's It For
The site acts as an online resume and a blog. I will publish blog posts about my personal projects. This is mainly for myself to concisely document different projects I am working on and  what are the potential findings from any research I have conducted towards the topic.

> This site is a personal web-page to showcase my projects and skills. The blog posts are written so that interested readers can learn something new
