Starting my journey with computational engineering.

[PicoGK][picogk-github] ('peacock') is an open-source geometry kernel.

## Coding for engineers
[Coding for engineers][coding-for-engineers] is a book published by Lin Kayser from LEAP71. The book is currently an ongoing project and Lin publishes new content one chapter at a time.

Lin covers the following on the first chapters of the book:
* Theory and concepts
* How to think about fitting code architecture for your application

Follow Lin on his [LinkedIn][linn-kayser-linkedin] to know when new chapters are released.

### Chapters 1-4
The first chapters are about learning why CEM is important.
